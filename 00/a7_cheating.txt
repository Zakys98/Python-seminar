## Cheating

Seriously, don't. Cheating wastes everyone's time and it reflects
really poorly on you. We consider any cooperation on practice
exercises (type ‹p›) and sets (type ‹s›) – i.e. anything you get
points for – to be cheating. There is plenty of other material for
studying together.

If you cheat and get caught, you will (in every instance separately,
where an instance is one week of practice exercises or a single
assignment from a set):

 • lose 1/2 of the points awarded for the affected work,
 • lose 10 points in the block (i.e. you will need to have earned 70
   on top of the points lost above),
 • lose additional 10 points from the overall score (this means
   that, as a special exception, you can still fail even if you pass
   each block – you also need 180 or 240 points total depending on
   ending type to get a passing grade; with both 10-point penalties
   applied, you need 200 or 260 points to pass despite the cheating
   incident… on a second incident, this increases to 220 and 280
   respectively, and so on).

Especially egregious cases of cheating will earn you a failing grade
(X) immediately.
