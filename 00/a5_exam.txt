## Final Exam

If your ending type is ‘colloquium (k)’, you need to complete the
4th block, which takes place in the exam period. In this block, you
can get points for reviews (for assignment set 3) and for the final
exam, which consists of 6 exercises, each worth 15 points. Since you
need 60 points to pass, that means either:

 • 4 out of 6 exam exercises,
 • 15+ points from reviews + 3 out of the 6 exam exercises.¹

The exercises will come from this collection (types ‹p›, ‹r› and
‹v›) and so shouldn't be too hard to solve if you passed the first
three blocks.² The main differences are:

 1. you won't be able to consult anyone at the exam, for real
    (though this should have been the case during the semester
    too!),
 2. no internet (and hence no googling and no ‹stackoverflow›), only
    this document (without the solution key) and the standard Python
    documentation.

In addition to the documentation, the exam computers will have the
following software installed:

 • Python interpreter (obviously) along with ‹mypy›,
 • a selection of text editors, VS Code and Thonny.

You will have a total of 4.5 hours to solve the exercises and you
will get interim ‘verity’ results (without counterexamples) every 90
minutes. Use of ‹mypy› at the exam will follow our use throughout
the semester: passing ‹mypy› will be required (and checked by syntax
tests, so you get early feedback), but strict mode will be only
enabled for exercises with sufficiently simple types.

¹ Yes, in theory you can get 30 points on reviews, but don't count
  on it. There are too many variables. 15 is very possible though.

² If you are worried, you can change the ending type to ‘z’, at the
  expense of 1 credit. On the other hand, don't be worried, the exam
  isn't any harder than what you did during the semester, and
  there's plenty of time.
