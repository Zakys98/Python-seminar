# S.1. Introductory Tasks

The programming tasks for this block are as follows:

 1. ‹a_while›   – an interpreter for simple ‘while programs’,
 2. ‹b_splay›   – a self-balancing binary search tree,
 3. ‹c_same›    – a solver for ‘same game’,
 4. ‹d_shelter› – a simple information system.

The tasks at hand only require basic programming skills and no
special tricks nor advanced Python constructs. Some of the tasks
require exceptions to be raised on errors, but again only basic use
is needed (you should be fine with ‹raise RuntimeError( 'foo' )›).

In the ‹splay› task, type annotations are optional, since they are a
little tricky (the tree is generic in the type of values, but these
values must be less-than comparable; you can find a ‘recipe’ for
solving this in ‹02/p1_dsw›).
