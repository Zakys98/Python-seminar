# Iterators, Coroutines

Demonstrations:

 1. (to be done)

Practice exercises in this chapter:

 1. ‹flat›    – flattening nested data with generators
 2. ‹send›    – understanding full coroutines
 3. ‹getline› – coroutine-based data streams
 4. ‹lexer›   – more streams
 5. ‹parser›  – coroutine-based lexer + parser combination
 6. ‹mbox›    – event-based (SAX-like) parsing with coroutines

Regular exercises:

 1. ‹iscan›   – iterator-based scanning
 2. ‹gscan›   – similar, but with generators
 3. ‹itree›   – iterating a binary tree
 4. ‹gtree›   – generators vs trees
 5. ‹dfs›     – walking graphs with coroutines
 6. ‹guided›  – A* search with coroutines

Voluntary exercises:
