# Memory management, reference counting

Please note that the content of this chapter might change
considerably before it comes up.

Demonstrations:

 1. (to be added)

Practice exercises:

 1. ‹refcnt›  – a reference counting manager
 2. ‹final›   – deterministic object finalization
 3. ‹reach›   – reachability from a set of roots
 4. ‹sweep›   – a mark and sweep collector
 5. ‹malloc›  – low-level memory management
 6. ‹trace›   – tracing composite objects

Regular exercises:

 1. ‹refcnt› – reference counting with data
 2. ‹reach›  – reachability again
 3. ‹sweep›  – mark and sweep v2
 4. ‹semi›   – a copying ‘semi-space’ collector
 5. ‹cheney› – improved version of the same
 6. ‹python› – reference counting + mark & sweep

Voluntary exercises:

 1. (nothing here yet)
